# SASE

Secure Access Service Edge (**SASE**) is a technology that combines Network as a Service with Security-as-a-Service capabilities. SASE is delivered through the cloud as-a-service consumption model, to support secure access for todays distributed/hybrid enterprise networks.

SASE was introduced because users began to access information from a variety of locations and devices, which
- expands attack surface
- introduces multi-level compliance requirements
- sophisticated cyber-threats

## SASE Capabilities
A SASE solution provides integrated networking and security capabilities including:
