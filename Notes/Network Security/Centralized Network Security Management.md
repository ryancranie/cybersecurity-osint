# Centralized Network Security Management

Data gathering can be done through
- logs
- Simple Network Management Protocol (**SNMP**)
	- the SNMP [protocol](https://notes.ryancranie.com/Notes/Network%20Technologies/Protocols) collects and organizes information on managed devices
- Application Programming Interface (**API**)
	- an API is a software interface allowing two devices to communicate with each other
	- allows for scripting
		- reduce manual tasks
		- reduce human error

## Data Fabric Architecture
Data fabric provides the possibility to monitor and manage data/applications wherever they are, whilst remaining centrally governed.
- Data Fabric stitches together the different parts of the security network to create a tapestry.
	- As data gathers more data, it uses AI to help consolidate more relevant data to improve decision making, and automate repetitive tasks
		- AI can use Machine Learning (**ML**) to make recommendations

### Fortinet Security Fabric
- Fortinet Security Fabric is an example of centralized network management
- open ecosystem to connect partners consisting of
	- APIs
	- fabric connectors
- broad view of the security and the network is provided through the Fabric Management Center
	- end-to-end visibility
- the security fabric links with FortiGuard
- automation in the security fabric can make dynamic adjustments to secure the entire attack surface provides Zero Trust Access

## Centralized Security Network Management Benefits
1. **High-level view and broad visibility**
	- centralized reports
	- simplified analyses of security events
	- avoid security issues
	- reduces incident response time
	- minimize disruptions
2. **Device integration**
	- centralized definition of configurations and policy orchestrations
3. **Reduction in repetitive/manual tasks**
4. **Easier maintenance**
	- application of patches
	- updates to monitoring
	- improved risk management
5. **Easier capacity and performance forecasting**
6. **Easier compliance audits**
