# Protocols
A protocol is a convention or standard that controls/enables the connection, communication, and data transfer between computing endpoints. Protocols are formal standards and policies comprised of rules governing the syntax, semantics and synchronization of computer communication. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or both.

> protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations

> protocols are to communication what algorithms are to computation

Protocols that are designed to work well together are known as a protocol suite, and to reach agreements; a protocol may be developed into a technical standard.
